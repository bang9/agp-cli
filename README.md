# AGP (Agentic Programming Project)

AGP is a CLI tool that creates a standardized, context-rich development environment for AI programming assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor.
By managing an isolated `.agp` directory as a Git submodule, AGP ensures consistent agentic behavior regardless of the platform or session.
It provides a unified structure for prompts, programming rules, documentation, and context fragmentsâ€”allowing AI to reason and generate code with minimal user friction and maximal clarity.
